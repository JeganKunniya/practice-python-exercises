Hello there,

Thanks for stopping by this project. 
I am creating and contributing to this repository for my work towards **'Python to Projects'** program, 
which is generously provided for Free by _@bhavaniravi__ and the _@TheLearningDev_.

I will be doing solutions for the exercises posted in https://www.practicepython.org/ site and 
enhancing my learning on Python journey.

Wish me luck!

Thank you
